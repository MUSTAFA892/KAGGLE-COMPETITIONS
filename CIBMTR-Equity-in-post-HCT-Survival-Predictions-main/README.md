# CIBMTR - Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions

This repository contains the code and datasets for the CIBMTR competition, which challenges participants to develop advanced predictive models to improve survival predictions for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). The goal is to ensure that these predictions are both accurate and fair, addressing disparities related to race, socioeconomic status, and geography.

## Overview

In this competition, you will develop models to predict transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). The challenge is to improve the accuracy and fairness of these predictions, especially considering disparities across different racial groups. The goal is to provide equitable survival predictions, ensuring that every patient has a fair chance of a successful outcome, regardless of their background.

The dataset provided for this competition is synthetic and mirrors real-world data, ensuring patient privacy while reflecting diverse backgrounds and conditions. You are encouraged to advance predictive modeling by using these data to develop algorithms that consider various patient demographics, including race and socioeconomic status.

## Competition Details

### Start
- **Started:** 2 months ago

### Close
- **Ends:** 17 days from today

### Description
Survival predictions for allogeneic HCT patients can fall short of addressing disparities in healthcare outcomes, especially those associated with race and geography. This competition aims to create models that improve the accuracy of survival predictions while accounting for these disparities. Your work will help enhance patient care, optimize resource utilization, and rebuild trust in the healthcare system.

### Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation will use the **Stratified Concordance Index (C-index)** to assess prediction accuracy, focusing on racial stratification. The C-index evaluates the model’s ability to rank survival times based on risk scores. The **Stratified Concordance Index** will adjust this calculation to ensure that predictions are fair across different racial groups.

- **C-index**: A score between 0 and 1 that measures the model’s discrimination power.
    - **0.5**: Random predictions
    - **1.0**: Perfect concordance
    - **0.0**: Perfect anti-concordance

- **Stratified C-index**: The mean minus the standard deviation of the C-index scores calculated within different racial categories. This metric ensures that the model performs equally well across various groups.

### Submission Format
Submit a CSV file containing real-valued risk scores, which are your model’s predictions of each patient’s likelihood of survival after transplantation.

The file must follow this format:

```
ID,prediction
28800,0.5
28801,1.2
28802,0.8
...
```

Where:
- `ID` refers to the identifier for each patient in the test dataset.
- `prediction` is the corresponding risk score generated by your model.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key components:

### `datasets/`
- This folder contains the datasets used in the competition. The datasets include training and testing data for building and evaluating models.

### `modeling.ipynb`
- This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission file generation.
- The notebook uses machine learning algorithms to predict survival risk scores and evaluates the fairness of these predictions across different racial groups.
