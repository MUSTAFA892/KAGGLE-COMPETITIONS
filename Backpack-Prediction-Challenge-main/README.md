# Backpack Prediction Challenge

## Overview
This project is part of the **Backpack Prediction Challenge** on Kaggle. The goal is to develop a model that predicts backpack prices based on given features.

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Datasets/        # Contains training and test datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ipynb       # Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Dataset
- The `Datasets/` folder contains all the required datasets for training and evaluation.
- Ensure the data is preprocessed correctly before training the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Place the dataset files inside the `Datasets/` folder.
3. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and generate predictions.

## Results
- The predictions are stored in a DataFrame and can be exported for submission.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by improving the model, cleaning the data, or optimizing the pipeline.
