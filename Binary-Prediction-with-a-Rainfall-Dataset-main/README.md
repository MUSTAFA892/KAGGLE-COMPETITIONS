# Binary Prediction with Rainfall Dataset

This project aims to build a binary prediction model using a dataset related to rainfall. The task involves predicting a binary outcome (e.g., "Rain or No Rain") using a set of features from the dataset. The project demonstrates the usage of Linear Regression, Standard Scaler, and normal data preprocessing techniques including imputation and train-test splitting.

### Datasets Folder
1. **train.csv**: Contains the training dataset with both features and target values.
2. **test.csv**: Contains the test dataset, which does not have the target values. This data is used to generate predictions and evaluate the model.
3. **sample_submission.csv**: A sample file with the required submission format (usually, predictions for the test dataset).

### main.ipynb
The main notebook where all of the preprocessing, model building, and evaluation occurs. It includes:
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Imputation of missing values
- Train-test split for model training and evaluation
- Model training using **Linear Regression** for binary prediction
- Model evaluation using **accuracy score**.

## Steps in the Project

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are imputed with the mean of the respective column to avoid data loss.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to normalize the data for the model.
   - **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 2. **Model Training**
   - **Linear Regression**: We use Linear Regression to build a model for binary prediction (the outcome variable is binary).
   
### 3. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Accuracy Score**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, comparing the predicted outcomes against the true labels in the test dataset.

### 4. **Submission**
   - The predicted binary values for the test dataset are written in the required format, ready for submission.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running `main.ipynb`)

### Install Dependencies
You can install all the required dependencies using `pip`. Here’s how to do it:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine to get started.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   Once cloned, navigate to the project folder where the `main.ipynb` is located.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) and run all the cells to execute the full pipeline:
   - Loading and preprocessing the dataset
   - Training the model
   - Evaluating performance
   - Making predictions for the test data

4. **Check the Results**:
   After running the notebook, you'll find the predictions for the test dataset, which can be submitted if required.

## Example Code in `main.ipynb`

Here’s a short snippet of how the model is built and evaluated in the notebook:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
import pandas as pd

# Load train data
train_data = pd.read_csv('datasets/train.csv')

# Preprocess the data
X = train_data.drop(columns=['target', 'rainfall', 'day'])
y = train_data['target']

# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_imputed)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

## Notes:
- The notebook assumes the `train.csv` file has a column named `target` for the binary target variable.
- You can modify the feature selection or imputation strategies depending on the dataset's characteristics.
  
## Conclusion
In this project, we built a linear regression model to predict a binary outcome based on various features, using techniques such as data preprocessing, feature scaling, and imputation. The accuracy of the model was evaluated, and predictions were generated for the test set.
