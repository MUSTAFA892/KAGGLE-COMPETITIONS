# KAGGLE_COMPETITIONS

This repository contains a collection of Kaggle competition solutions, including datasets, code, and notebooks. Each subdirectory is dedicated to a specific competition, featuring complete data pipelines, feature engineering, modeling approaches, and evaluation metrics.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder typically includes:
- 📁 `data/` – Processed or raw datasets (where permitted by competition rules)
- 📄 `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, model development, and results
- 🧠 `models/` – Trained models or scripts for training
- ⚙️ `scripts/` – Utility scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- 📈 `results/` – Performance metrics, visualizations, and leaderboards

> **Note:** All solutions are for educational and reference purposes. Datasets included comply with their respective competition licenses.

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Showcase practical data science workflows
